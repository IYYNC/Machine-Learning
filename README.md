# Machine-Learning
Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I document my journey through the Machine Learning course (BAX-452) offered in Winter 2024 at the University of California, Davis, Graduate School of Management. This repository serves as a portfolio of projects, assignments, and key learnings from the course, showcasing my growth and understanding in the field of machine learning.

### Course Overview
Under the guidance of Assistant Professor JÃ¶rn Boehnke, this course provided an in-depth exploration of machine learning techniques and their application to large, high-dimensional datasets. The curriculum covered a broad range of topics, from regression and classification to neural networks and reinforcement learning, emphasizing both theoretical concepts and practical computational skills.

#### Topics Covered:
- Introduction to Machine Learning
- Regression Techniques
- Treatment Effects Analysis
- Bootstrap Methods
- Model Selection Strategies
- Classification Algorithms
- Clustering Techniques
- Factor Analysis
- Decision Trees
- Neural Networks and Deep Learning
- Natural Language Processing
- Large Language Models

### Projects and Assignments
This repository contains my work on various projects and assignments that were integral to the course. Each project folder includes detailed Jupyter notebooks, data files, and a README explaining the objectives, methodologies, and outcomes of the project. Assignments are designed to reinforce learning and apply concepts to real-world datasets.

### Final Group Project
The capstone of the course was a final group project where we applied machine learning concepts to solve a business problem of our choice. This project not only tested our technical skills but also our ability to translate complex analyses into actionable business insights.

### Learning Resources and Tools
The course placed a strong emphasis on Python for all computational tasks, aligning with industry trends. I've included a resources directory where I share some of the external learning materials and Python libraries that were instrumental in my learning journey.

### Reflections and Key Takeaways
I've dedicated a section of this repository to share my reflections on the course, key takeaways, and how it has shaped my understanding of machine learning. This section is a personal narrative of my growth, challenges, and achievements throughout the course.

### Contributing
While this repository primarily serves as a personal documentation of my learning journey, I welcome feedback, suggestions, and discussions from the community. If you're also a learner or an expert in the field, feel free to connect and share your insights.
